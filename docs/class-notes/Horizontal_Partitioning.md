Horizontal partitioning is a style of [[partitions]] which simply separates different rows into different tables. 

This is frequently done on a clear split in some feature of the data, such as geographic location, age-groups, income groups, etc.

This is in contrast to another form of partitioning: [[Vertical_Partitioning]]
